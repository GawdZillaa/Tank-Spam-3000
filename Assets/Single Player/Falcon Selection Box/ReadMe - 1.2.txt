 Version History
-----------------

- Greatly improved the GetBoundsScreenCoordinatesMethod, to detect the selection independent of the camera rotation or angle.
- Moved the selection detection method to the Selectable class. Now each selectable can have a different way of selection. By default Edge and Center are provided.
- Added a convenient method to GLBoxSelector to display the bounding boxes used by the system to detect the selection.
- Added a new script to easily deselect all objects on click - DeselectAllClickHandler.
- Added some code to the DragHandler script to detect if the DeselectAllClickHandler is present. If it is it will synchronize with it.
